Trashmower (temporary name) is an Android application meant to be a
mobile companion for Swarthmore students.

At this time the app is in the very early stages.

Features:
	- wrapper for MySwarthmore online interface (sort of completed)
	- directory combining Cygnet and the one on the Dash (TODO)
	- Marauder's Map of the campus using Google Maps (in progress)
	- selected features from the Dash, such as: (all TODO)
		- available food (on campus, plus directions to nearby establishments)
		- events on campus
		- train schedules
		- weather forecast
	- interface to selected SCCS services, such as: (all TODO)
		- GUTS (create SCCS account, create mailing list, etc)
		- Concierge (reserve SCCS space/equipment)
	- maybe more, but that's enough dreaming for one README file
